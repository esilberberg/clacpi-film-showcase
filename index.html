                    <p>CLACPI was founded in 1985 and is currently the largest collective of indigenous filmmakers in Latin America. They promote the use of media as a tool of cultural affirmation and social transformation for indigenous communities. CLACPI produces and disseminates audiovisual materials about indigenous cultures and other issues of interest for their collective organizations. They also focus on grassroots media training and workshops to promote agency and self-representation among indigenous communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Highlights of the program include an indigenous film showcase curated by Nelly Kuiru Castro, Norma Rocío Gómez Semanate, Andres Tapia Arias, and David Hernández Palmar.

                    <p>How do we begin to unpack “Indigenous Latinidad” within an ant-colonial framework? The growing presence of an Indigenous diaspora from Latin America is shifting and raising questions about transnational meanings of race and indigeneity. Although Latinidad has, for a while now, been somewhat of a fractured term, raising questions around the monolithic tendencies associated with it, the growing presence of Latinx people identifying with their Indigenous communities in Latin America, but relegated to the large Latinx narrative, begs us to recognize broaden limitations in Latinx studies. How can we analyze the large current waves of migration and displacement without considering the impacts of illegal mining, contaminated water, land grab policies, and the arrival of green energy industries in Indigenous territories with faux promises of employment and economic development? </p>
                    <p>Across academia, we see a rising population of first-generation Indigenous students categorized within Latinx societal frameworks, yet seeking to strengthen Indigenous languages, culture, and traditions of their communities in Latin America. This movement not only challenges monolithic perceptions of Latinx identities but also notions of settler-colonialism and the legitimacy of borders. How do Indigenous Latinx people contend with being positioned as part of a settler colonial force that dispossesses Native American Nations (in Turtle Island) continuously fighting for their sovereignty? How is an Indigenous Latinx consciousness forged and how can it challenge dominant narratives of migration and belonging?</p>
                    <p>The goal of the panel is to hold an open conversation with Indigenous youth in Abya Yala and Turtle Island about the challenges their communities endure in the face of extractive federal policies and corporate interests leading to consistent land dispossession, water insecurity, and violence against Indigenous women. We recognize the precarious similarities between frontline communities in the United States and Latin America and young people's imperative role in raising these issues and stories on large international stages and in public institutions. While the policies that threaten the livelihoods of Indigenous peoples shift across “national borders,” they are nevertheless predicated on denying Indigenous peoples the right to live safely in their Native communities and/or sovereignty. How can we work together to challenge corporate interests and extractive policies, while also problematizing the dominant and monolithic narratives placed on us?</p>

                    <p>Beginning with the principles of critical and decolonial cartography, we use a map with equal area projection, and oriented with east to the top, as Nahuas did in their codices and as Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala famously did in the world map from his First New Chronicle and Good Government (1600-1615). The colors come from a map of nature, and the symbols and constellations come from several Indigenous cultures, including the Taino and Mayan cultures.</p>
                    <p>A database, in conjunction with the ArcGIS digital mapping program, will populate the map with points. By pressing these points, a window will open with information provided by the CLACPI organization: name of the organization, brief description of it, website or social media page, and links to one or two films. The map in this way will function as a sample of films curated by CLACPI members themselves, and will help make visible the geographical diversity of the organization, processes and/or communication groups in Latin America and the thematic diversity of its audiovisual productions.</p>
