                                Inchishashiyi Barí (Our Barí Children), is one of the few existing documentaries about the Barí people, often wrongly referred to as called Motilones. This documentary is made specifically by Barí people, highlighting their origin story and how children from the Ichirrindakayra community learn about being Barí. Aerial images place us in a forest nestled in mountains as beautiful as they are mysterious. As we are invited into their territory, we see how children learn from the teachings of their grandparents, and from life in the community, where the heirs of wise warriors who inhabited the Barí world since its beginnings, coexist.

The film, encompassing materials from the year 1980 to the last decade, and first-hand testimonies of Indigenous leaders, reminds us that these conflicts have not ended and that the memories of struggle must be transmitted to youth, as a legacy of what was done and still remains to be done.

                            <p class="details">Guided by the ancestral strength of Karo Sakaybu, the greatest warrior and creator of the Tapajós River and the Munduruku people, Chief Juarez denounces the threats to life posed by the invasions of loggers and miners in the Sawré Muybu territory, while uniting his people in the fight for the demarcation of the territory. Munduruku women are one of the main forces in this fight, and they courageously face their enemies, whether in the territory, in the streets, or in Congress. Self-demarcation becomes the only way after the indigenous land is recognized, but there is no government action to demarcate or curb invasions. “Why don’t we demarcate, since the land is ours?”. Self-demarcation is full of challenges and confrontations, but the Munduruku warriors are at the forefront of this fight and expel their invaders with courage and resistance. Sawé!</p>

                            <p class="details">In the Puna region of Argentina, specifically in Salinas Grandes (Jujuy, Salta), a conflict has been growing since 2010  over lithium mining activity. Faced with the large construction of multinational companies for the exploration of metal, 33 Communities of the Kolla-Atacamas are grouped in the Mesa de la Cuenca de Salinas Grandes and Laguna de Guayatayoc to defend their territories and demand that the State and companies fulfill their rights to Free, Prior and Informed Consultation. The documentary covers some of the most significant voices of these communities, who accknowlege the Territory as imperative to their worldview. This story offers a profound message about the protection of life that, as a reality, bears the dream of Community as an ancestral form, that continues to survive.

In the film, Richella performs a couple of traditional dances in various events wearing her traditional attire and, later on, having conversations with an Indigenous Activist-Ding Hibau, in trying to understand why her hobby is actually making an impact on her people</p>

                    <p>How do we begin to unpack “Indigenous Latinidad” within an ant-colonial framework? The growing presence of an Indigenous diaspora from Latin America is shifting and raising questions about transnational meanings of race and indigeneity. Although Latinidad has, for a while now, been somewhat of a fractured term, raising questions around the monolithic tendencies associated with it, the growing presence of Latinx people identifying with their Indigenous communities in Latin America, but relegated to the large Latinx narrative, begs us to recognize broaden limitations in Latinx studies. How can we analyze the large current waves of migration and displacement without considering the impacts of illegal mining, contaminated water, land grab policies, and the arrival of green energy industries in Indigenous territories with faux promises of employment and economic development? </p>
                    <p>Across academia, we see a rising population of first-generation Indigenous students categorized within Latinx societal frameworks, yet seeking to strengthen Indigenous languages, culture, and traditions of their communities in Latin America. This movement not only challenges monolithic perceptions of Latinx identities but also notions of settler-colonialism and the legitimacy of borders. How do Indigenous Latinx people contend with being positioned as part of a settler colonial force that dispossesses Native American Nations (in Turtle Island) continuously fighting for their sovereignty? How is an Indigenous Latinx consciousness forged and how can it challenge dominant narratives of migration and belonging?</p>
                    <p>The goal of the panel is to hold an open conversation with Indigenous youth in Abya Yala and Turtle Island about the challenges their communities endure in the face of extractive federal policies and corporate interests leading to consistent land dispossession, water insecurity, and violence against Indigenous women. We recognize the precarious similarities between frontline communities in the United States and Latin America and young people's imperative role in raising these issues and stories on large international stages and in public institutions. While the policies that threaten the livelihoods of Indigenous peoples shift across “national borders,” they are nevertheless predicated on denying Indigenous peoples the right to live safely in their Native communities and/or sovereignty. How can we work together to challenge corporate interests and extractive policies, while also problematizing the dominant and monolithic narratives placed on us?</p>

                    <p>Beginning with the principles of critical and decolonial cartography, we use a map with equal area projection, and oriented with east to the top, as Nahuas did in their codices and as Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala famously did in the world map from his First New Chronicle and Good Government (1600-1615). The colors come from a map of nature, and the symbols and constellations come from several Indigenous cultures, including the Taino and Mayan cultures.</p>
                    <p>A database, in conjunction with the ArcGIS digital mapping program, will populate the map with points. By pressing these points, a window will open with information provided by the CLACPI organization: name of the organization, brief description of it, website or social media page, and links to one or two films. The map in this way will function as a sample of films curated by CLACPI members themselves, and will help make visible the geographical diversity of the organization, processes and/or communication groups in Latin America and the thematic diversity of its audiovisual productions.</p>
